I noticed one member did no work beyond what they did last term (which was impressive amount) and the other team member ignored all styling and did pretty much the minimum.

They understood my disappointment, agreed they could have done more, and said they'd catch up and stick to the timeline. Since I was the only one who organized our project I asked them if they wanted to make any changes, because I expected I may have given too little time for hard features and too much time for easy features.

I narrowed down what was core to our application and asked my team if we could get there.

From this decision, the game came together for me. I made pieces that move like a knight, bishop and rook. (Queen movement was overpowered) Each piece had abilities that gave them purpose. By having more pieces the player has more options to attack without moving, but they have to balance what pieces they want to move out of the way of damage.
