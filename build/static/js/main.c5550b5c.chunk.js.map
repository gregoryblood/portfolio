The big challenge was not only hooking up the Spotify \r\n              Authentification, but learning ReactJS while doing it. I knew it would be a \r\n              large project for me to do solo but I was pretty happy with how it turned out.\r\n              It was also fun trying to conform to a design trend while adhering to Spotify's \r\n              logo usages. In the end I really like the look on mobile but wish I drafted \r\n              something different for larger screens. \r\n            </Text>\r\n            <ImgLong src={mm2}/>\r\n            <Header>\r\n              About\r\n            </Header>\r\n            <Tools>ReactJS (HTML5/CSS3/Javascript) - Express</Tools>\r\n            <Text>\r\n              This app's purpose was to sort the user's Spotify music. I developed it on my own \r\n              using ReactJS as well as an Express server to manage Spotify's authentication process. \r\n              <br/><br/>\r\n              Once logged in, the user can view their top artists and songs as well as their current playlists. \r\n              If they select a playlist they will see all songs with their respective artists. If \r\n              they click the button at the top the app will automatically create a new playlist with \r\n              the same name with a plus sign at the end. That playlist will have all of the same songs \r\n              but they will be sorted by Spotify's interpretation of how energetic the song is. This playlist \r\n              is now visible to the user and does not replace the old playlist. (This is to allow the user \r\n              to decide if they like how it was sorted and so they aren't worried the app will mess something up)\r\n              <br/><br/>\r\n              The Spotify API offers statistics for each song given such as how acoustic it is or how \r\n              vocal it is. I wanted it to make my playlists seem like I sorted with slow songs first and \r\n              high paced songs at the end. I first used BPM to sort but didn't like how it ended up sorting.\r\n              A big issue was some songs started sounding like they were really slow, like AC/DC's Thunderstruck,\r\n              and would pick up later, which I wanted to be towards the beginning of the playlist. I ended up \r\n              sorting by the 'Energy' of the song. Which takes into account multiple factors, including BPM, to \r\n              return a single decimal number for me to sort. \r\n              <br/><br/>\r\n              For the design I tried the trend of Neomorphism. The essence of the trend is to make the screen \r\n              looks like it has soft 3D buttons. I knew that this was going to be hard since I also wanted my app to \r\n              feel like it was part of the Spotify ecosystem. I quickly realized that Spotify's background colors were \r\n              very dark and the design looked best on brighter backgrounds. I settled on a dark navy blue which \r\n              looks a lot better on bright screens. I made the site responsive as well and really enjoyed how it \r\n              turned out on mobile. When I go back to this project I will probably update the overall design \r\n              strategy to make it more 'Spotifyie'.\r\n            </Text>\r\n            <Img src={mm4} />\r\n          </Body>\r\n          \r\n        </Core>\r\n      </React.Fragment>\r\n    );\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default MusicMajik;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport {PTitle, Body, Core, Header, Flavor, Portal, TitleBar,\r\n        Tools, Text} from './style';\r\nimport {Buttons, HotButton, Disclaimer} from '../Components/Body';\r\n\r\nexport class WhatToWear extends React.Component {  \r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0)\r\n  };\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <React.Fragment>\r\n        <span id=\"top\"/>\r\n        <TitleBar>\r\n          <PTitle>WhatToWear</PTitle>\r\n          <Flavor>The Most Fail-Safe Weather App...</Flavor>\r\n        </TitleBar>\r\n        <Core>\r\n          <Body>\r\n            <Portal src=\"https://www.gregoryblood.me/weatherapi/\" width=\"540\" height=\"450\"></Portal>\r\n            <Disclaimer>Due to DarkSky's API changes, this no longer works</Disclaimer>\r\n\r\n            <Buttons>\r\n              <a href='https://www.gregoryblood.me/weatherapi/' target='_blank'><HotButton>Visit</HotButton></a>\r\n              <a href='https://github.com/gregoryblood/gregoryblood.github.io/tree/master/weatherapi' target='_blank'><HotButton>GitHub</HotButton></a>\r\n            </Buttons>\r\n            <Header>\r\n              What I Learned\r\n            </Header>\r\n            <Tools>API calls - Geolocation - Website deploying</Tools>\r\n            <Text>\r\n              This was my first site that I wanted to deploy, use, and share.

Their original idea was a full-stack website that tracked inventory and could \r\n              do the purchasing of honey without the use of a third party. While I was excited to take on the \r\n              challenge, I told them they could minimize upfront costs (my hourly labor fee) by selling the \r\n              honey on Amazon and for me to build more of an info page she could share that linked to Amazon. \r\n              If they sold enough honey, I could always upgrade the website.\r\n              <br/><br/>\r\n              Once we settled on our strategy, I began to make some drafts. I created four templates in AdobeXD \r\n              each with different styles and asked them what they liked and disliked about each one. Taking in that \r\n              input I created another draft that they later approved. With the design decided it was just left to me \r\n              to build it. I went with ReactJS since it might have been built more upon. \r\n              <br/><br/>\r\n              Once built I begin to look into selling honey on Amazon.

(Non-potentially hazardous foods that do not require time and/or temperature controls for safety)\r\n              I told them about their local laws and am currently waiting for them to finish that process. \r\n            </Text>\r\n            \r\n          </Body>\r\n        </Core>\r\n      </React.Fragment>\r\n    );\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default PureHoney;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport {PTitle, Body, Core, Header, Flavor, Portal, TitleBar,\r\n        Tools, Text, Img} from './style';\r\nimport {Buttons, HotButton} from '../Components/Body';\r\n\r\nexport class Ships extends React.Component {  \r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0)\r\n  };\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <React.Fragment>\r\n        <span id=\"top\"/>\r\n        <TitleBar>\r\n          <PTitle>Ships!</PTitle>\r\n          <Flavor>A party game for pirates...</Flavor>\r\n        </TitleBar>\r\n        <Core>\r\n          <Body>\r\n            <Portal height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VS7Dm7YzTsQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allow=\"fullscreen\"></Portal>\r\n            <Buttons>\r\n              {\r\n              //<a href='https://www.gregoryblood.me/honey/#/' target='_blank'><HotButton>Visit</HotButton></a>\r\n              }\r\n              <a href='https://github.com/gregoryblood/ships' target='_blank'><HotButton>GitHub</HotButton></a>\r\n            </Buttons>\r\n            <Header>\r\n              What I Learned\r\n            </Header>\r\n            <Tools>Interactive Controls - Unity Fundamentals - Gameplay Fundamentals</Tools>\r\n            <Text>\r\n              After following a lot of tutorials for using Unity, I finally felt confident to work on my own project. \r\n              I had an idea in mind to start and just went to work.

I iterated through a few \r\n              ideas but settled on this asteroid  like game. The theme was a fun way to focus my ideas and it was really fun stretching \r\n              the meaning of the theme.<br/><br/>\r\n              I ended up making the player lose control of their ship after a certain amount of time while simultaneously increasing their fire rate.\r\n              This made the player carefully predict where the ship was going and would point to score points and not lose health. \r\n              <br/><br/>\r\n              I learned an important lesson about accessibility when I didn't realize I could have the game played in the \r\n              browser at the time of my submission.

The player starts the game by \r\n              selecting options for their ship (27 combinations total) each complimenting different builds. \r\n              The player controls their ship with a gamepad or WASD and it automatically fires. The hook is if they \r\n              press space or the south gamepad button, their ship loses all acceleration dampening and fires rapidly. While they \r\n              can only spin the ship, it is the strongest way to defeat enemies. \r\n              <br/><br/>\r\n              Their objective is to destroy enemies to increase their score. There are five different enemies each \r\n              having drastically behaviors and mechanics. They are introduced at different point thresholds to increase \r\n              difficulty. At 200, 400, and 600 points, a boss spawns with completely new mechanics and take multiple hits \r\n              to defeat. The game is intended to be infinitely long lasting with increasing difficulty.\r\n              <br/><br/>\r\n              As enemies are destroyed they have a chance to drop coins, that the player can exchange at milestones to \r\n              upgrade their ship/stats. Some of the possible upgrades compliment the choices, or even \r\n              directly upgrade, the choices they made at the beginning. Because of this they can create \r\n              builds that get exponentially stronger.\r\n            </Text>\r\n            \r\n          </Body>\r\n        </Core>\r\n      </React.Fragment>\r\n    );\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default MasterBlaster;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport {PTitle, Body, Core, Header, Flavor, Portal, TitleBar,\r\n        Tools, Text, Img, ImgLong} from './style';\r\nimport {Buttons, HotButton, Link} from '../Components/Body';\r\nimport capstone from '../Images/capstone.PNG'\r\n\r\nexport class Capstone extends React.Component {  \r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0)\r\n  };\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <React.Fragment>\r\n        <span id=\"top\"/>\r\n        <TitleBar>\r\n          <PTitle>Senior Project</PTitle>\r\n          <Flavor>The 'I' in 'Team'...</Flavor>\r\n        </TitleBar>\r\n        <Core>\r\n          <Body>\r\n            \r\n            <Buttons>\r\n              <a href='https://xd.adobe.com/view/8076e940-3750-4138-a939-32692b7e0e67-d525/?fullscreen' target='_blank'><HotButton>Interact</HotButton></a>\r\n              <a href='https://github.com/gregoryblood/Event-Management-App' target='_blank'><HotButton>GitHub</HotButton></a>\r\n            </Buttons>\r\n            <Header>\r\n              About\r\n            </Header>\r\n            <Tools>React Native (Mobile Development) - Express - Postgres (Database) - SQL</Tools>\r\n            <Text>\r\n            This app was for my senior capstone, a 9-month group project. I picked this specific \r\n          project because I wanted to something that I felt challenged me and had a tangable result \r\n          that I would enjoy talking about.<br/><br/>\r\n          Our goal given to us by a professor in the College of Business at Oregon State University was \r\n          to develop an app for the school that streamlines the process for students to find out about events \r\n          going on around the school. We worked closely with the professor to figure out key features of the app and \r\n          the design. Administrators would needed to be identified at login, and have the ability to create/edit/delete \r\n          events. Students could then sign-up for whichever event they want to attend and have their calendar \r\n          updated. \r\n              <br/><br/>\r\n              One of the challenges of this project, and in my opinion the most important, is being a team-leader to  \r\n          two other students and working with a professor and a teacher's assistant. There isn't a right way to do this project.\r\n          I just knew I wanted a professional looking application that the school could consider using to help students. \r\n          <br/><br/>\r\n          </Text>\r\n          <Tools>Leadership</Tools>\r\n            <Text>\r\n              Being a leader isn't an easy task. While we didn't take an official vote, my starting skill set and attitude towards \r\n              the project made me the best fit for the role, and I was happy to take it knowing it doesn't mean I can just give other \r\n              people my work. I wanted to lead by example. I listened to my teammates worries about working with new tools, and opted \r\n              to create the back-end, a new frontier for me. I listened to my teammates worry about planning such a large project, and got \r\n              to work giving us direction. \r\n              <br/><br/>\r\n              A challenge I wasn't expecting is how I needed to act. Since I consider myself easy-going for the most part, I determined \r\n              I'd have to change my demeanor if I felt my team needed the pressure. I of course want to be friends with everyone and didn't \r\n              want to add any unnecessary stress, but at the end of the day we have a product to build and a time limit to worry about. I decided \r\n              to keep a blog of events at the bottom of this page mainly to help me evaluate myself as a team-leader. \r\n              \r\n            </Text>\r\n            <ImgLong src={capstone}/>\r\n            <Header>\r\n              Fall Blog\r\n            </Header>\r\n            <Tools>\"Plans are useless but planning is indispensable.\" - Dwight D. Eisenhower</Tools>\r\n            <Text>\r\n              We're making an application for a professor at the College of Business at Oregon State to create a better way for \r\n              students and faculty to manage events. I'm working with two other students to get this done \r\n              and we also have help from a TA to make sure we're making progress. I opted to take a leadership \r\n              role for my team because not only was I experienced with how React worked, but I also wanted to \r\n              make this app look and perform like it was made by professionals and felt the most confident to get this done. \r\n              <br/><br/>I designed the app, you can interact with it above, and I created a timeline \r\n              for our team to finish a working prototype by the end of March. I assigned my team members with \r\n              creating the front-end, since they felt the most comfortable with it, and I got to work on the back-end.\r\n              <br/><br/>\r\n              I immedietly researched different tools that we would need to learn to accomplish our task. \r\n          I decided to use React Native for the front end since it allowed us to develop for both IOS, \r\n          Android, and web which was ideal since we weren't experienced with app development.\r\n          I then worked closely with the professor to create a <Link href='https://xd.adobe.com/view/8076e940-3750-4138-a939-32692b7e0e67-d525/?fullscreen'>design prototype </Link>\r\n          that would help us plan out the features we would have, the user interface and experience, and helped us \r\n          all be on the page when we would start to develop. <br/><br/>\r\n          To begin development I created a <Link href='https://www.heroku.com/home'>Heroku </Link> server to host an express server.\r\n          Next I started our React Native app and set it up to be able to make API calls. This was mainly to help the group see \r\n          what React frameworks look like. I also set a timeline of the entire app development for us to follow. \r\n              <br/><br/>\r\n            </Text>\r\n            <Header>\r\n              Winter Blog\r\n            </Header>\r\n            <Tools>\"Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\" - Mike Tyson</Tools>\r\n            <Text>\r\n              The biggest challenge hasn't been the technical side of the project but the team side. The term started off seeming \r\n              fine. Every member agreed with my timeline and said they started work. In week 3 (of 10) I requested for everyone to \r\n              merge their work to Github so we could see all of the progress we've made since we were to present it to other teams soon. I noticed one member did no work beyond what \r\n              they did last term (which was impressive amount) and the other team member ignored all styling and did pretty much \r\n              the minimum. I did expect this, I know people can get busy and have to prioritize their time. Something like this Capstone \r\n              doesn't have any grades and there's no risk of being fired, so of course it can be difficult to respect deadlines.\r\n              <br/><br/>\r\n              We gave a presentation in which we focused more on how I set-up our backend and our goals for the term. Afterwards I got my team together \r\n              and let them know I would have liked to see more effort put in. I listened to what my teammates had to say. They understood my disappointment, \r\n              agreed they could have done more, and said they'd catch up and stick to the timeline. Since I was the only one who organized \r\n              our project I asked them if they wanted to make any changes, because I expected I may have given too little time for hard features and \r\n              too much time for easy features. They both said it was still good and so we left the meeting with the plan unchanged.\r\n              <br/><br/> \r\n              At the end of week 7 our project partner asked about when a demo would become available. This caused me to request we all merged our project, \r\n              and gave a realistic evaluation of where we're at. Both members completed what was required earlier, but still didn't match the \r\n              styling with what we had designed. So now was time to pivot. I narrowed down what was core to our application and asked my team \r\n              if we could get there. After finding an agreement, I created a new, short-term timeline to plan what each of us was to do to get a demo \r\n              working by week 10. \r\n            </Text>\r\n            \r\n          </Body>\r\n        </Core>\r\n      </React.Fragment>\r\n    );\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Capstone;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport {PTitle, Body, Core, Header, Flavor, Portal, TitleBar,\r\n        Tools, Text, Img} from './style';\r\nimport {Buttons, HotButton} from '../Components/Body';\r\n\r\nexport class Overseer extends React.Component {  \r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0)\r\n  };\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <React.Fragment>\r\n        <span id=\"top\"/>\r\n        <TitleBar>\r\n          <PTitle>Overseer</PTitle>\r\n          <Flavor>Physics puzzles with horror...</Flavor>\r\n        </TitleBar>\r\n        <Core>\r\n          <Body>\r\n            <Header>\r\n              What I Learned\r\n            </Header>\r\n            <Tools>AI Behaiviors - Playtesting</Tools>\r\n            <Text>\r\n              After following a lot of tutorials for using Unity, I finally felt confident to work on my own project. \r\n              I had an idea in mind to start and just went to work.

I had a full week to make something around the \"Stronger together\" theme but I wasn't sure \r\n              how much time I would actually have since school was my priority. \r\n              <br/><br/>\r\n              Because of potential crunch, I just started developing without any real plan. I knew I wanted to make a \r\n              methodical 2D game with high replayability. I started out with a 5x5 board with a piece that could move \r\n              around using WASD and ended with a turn-based, roguelike that used chess piece movement. While you could read the \r\n              full detail of my progress below, I'll summarize by saying I needed to 'Find the fun' by playing what I had and \r\n              running with what worked. Overall I was really happy with what I made given the circumstances. \r\n            </Text>\r\n            <Img src = {kg2}/>\r\n            <Header>\r\n              About\r\n            </Header>\r\n            <Tools>Unity - C#</Tools>\r\n            <Text>\r\n            Alarm goes off, Saturday 2:00am, I check my phone for the Brakeys 2021.1 theme to start thinking about ideas.<br/><br/>\"Stronger Together\" \r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            My second alarm goes off at 8:00am, I wake up without a clue of what I'm going to do. I knew I had a pact schedule of\r\n            this, work, and school so I know I have to work quickly while I have the time. I had a general sense of what I've been \r\n            wanting to do which was a roguelike you only need 1 finger to play but a lot of brainpower to play well. So I opened up \r\n            Unity and went to work creating a board, a player, and a WASD movement system.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            I'm no pixel-artist, so I went to the Asset store to grab whatever I can see and it just so happened my \r\n            placeholder for the player was a king. This will come up later. I went with the easiest form of conflict, \r\n            evil enemies with health and damage, and ended up with a stat-check game where the player threw themselves \r\n            at enemies and enemies threw themselves at the player. To add a way for the player to win I created items like \r\n            healthpots, swords to increase the player's attack, shields to block damage, and coins for something I'd add later. (like a shop)\r\n            I added enemies with different stats and started playtesting.<br/><br/>It was perfect and I was done within 24 hours.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            I wish.\r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            The game didn't fit the theme and worst of all, it wasn't fun. It was boring and I felt like calling a quits. I closed my \r\n            computer tired and frustrated. The next day I had to knock out homework and I didn't touch my game as I knew I needed to \r\n            think of a way to make it fun. Monday started, I had no homework, no work, but no ideas. Not wanting to do nothing, \r\n            I followed my previous plan and just started coding things. I updated the movement system to selecting one piece and moving \r\n            to specific spots, and then making the enemies mark where they're going to do damage as well as different patterns. \r\n            <br/>\r\n            <Img src = {kg3}/>\r\n            The game all of a sudden got better. It added choice: run or attack. To add difficulty, I made either the health or the \r\n            attack of enemies scale with the time elapse over the game. I could have made it scale from turns but figured I want to \r\n            pressure the player into making more mistakes. \r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            Now that the game was sort of fun, I needed to work on the theme. I decided on adding allies the player could control. This \r\n            added more choice for the player and therefore required more thought. Perfect! While I was brainstorming ways this ally can \r\n            move I thought to the game my board looked an awful like with a piece my main character was already. Chess! From this decision, \r\n            the game came together for me. I made pieces that move like a knight, bishop and rook. (Queen movement was overpowered) Each piece \r\n            had abilities that gave them purpose. By having more pieces the player has more options to attack without moving, but they have to \r\n            balance what pieces they want to move out of the way of damage. Some pieces felt better than others and the game as a whole could use \r\n            more testing and difficulty adjusting but by then I was out of time and needed to submit.  \r\n            </Text>\r\n            \r\n          </Body>\r\n        </Core>\r\n      </React.Fragment>\r\n    );\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default KingsGambit;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport Title from './Components/Title'\r\nimport Body from './Components/Body'\r\nimport { useRouteMatch, Switch, Route} from 'react-router-dom';\r\nimport Navbar from './Components/Navbar';\r\nimport MusicMajik from './Pages/musicmagik';\r\nimport WhatToWear from './Pages/whattowear';\r\nimport PureHoney from './Pages/purehoney';\r\nimport Ships from './Pages/ships';\r\nimport MasterBlaster from './Pages/masterblaster';\r\nimport Capstone from './Pages/capstone';\r\nimport Overseer from './Pages/overseer';\r\nimport KingsGambit from './Pages/kingsgambit'\r\n\r\nclass App extends React.Component  {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <Navbar/>\r\n        <Switch>\r\n        <Route path=\"/capstone\">\r\n            <Capstone/>\r\n          </Route>\r\n          <Route path=\"/master-blaster\">\r\n            <MasterBlaster/>\r\n          </Route>\r\n          <Route path=\"/whattowear\">\r\n            <WhatToWear/>\r\n          </Route>\r\n          <Route path=\"/musicmajik\">\r\n            <MusicMajik/>\r\n          </Route>\r\n          <Route path=\"/purehoney\">\r\n            <PureHoney/>\r\n          </Route>\r\n          <Route path=\"/ships\">\r\n            <Ships/>\r\n          </Route>\r\n          <Route path=\"/overseer\">\r\n            <Overseer/>\r\n          </Route>\r\n          <Route path=\"/kings-gambit\">\r\n            <KingsGambit/>\r\n          </Route>\r\n          <Route path=\"/\">\r\n            <Title/>\r\n            <Body/>\r\n          </Route>\r\n        </Switch>\r\n        \r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n//<Navbar/>\r\nexport default App;\r\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\r\n// register() is not called by default.\r\n\r\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\r\n// it offline capabilities.
