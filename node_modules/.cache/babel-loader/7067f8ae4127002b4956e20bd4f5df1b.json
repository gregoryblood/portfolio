Because I was the most experienced with \r\n          the kind of development we were doing, I was put in a leadership role.\r\n              <br/><br/>\r\n              I immedietly researched different tools that we would need to learn to accomplish our task. \r\n          I decided to use React Native for the front end since it allowed us to develop for both IOS, \r\n          Android, and web which was ideal since we weren't experienced with app development.\r\n          I then worked closely with the professor to create a <Link href='https://xd.adobe.com/view/8076e940-3750-4138-a939-32692b7e0e67-d525/?fullscreen'>design prototype </Link>\r\n          that would help us plan out the features we would have, the user interface and experience, and helped us \r\n          all be on the page when we would start to develop. <br/><br/>\r\n          To begin development I created a <Link href='https://www.heroku.com/home'>Heroku </Link> server to host an express server.\r\n          Next I started our React Native app and set it up to be able to make API calls. This was mainly to help the group see \r\n          what React frameworks look like. I also set a timeline of the entire app development for us to follow. \r\n            </Text>\r\n            <ImgLong src={capstone}/>\r\n          </Body>\r\n        </Core>\r\n      </React.Fragment>\r\n    );\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Capstone;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
