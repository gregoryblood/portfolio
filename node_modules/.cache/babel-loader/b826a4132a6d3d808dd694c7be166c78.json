Students could then sign-up for whichever event they want to attend and have their calendar \r\n          updated. \r\n              <br/><br/>\r\n              One of the challenges of this project, and in my opinion the most important, is being a team-leader to  \r\n          two other students and working with a professor and a teacher's assistant. There isn't a right way to do this project.\r\n          I just knew I wanted a professional looking application that the school could consider using to help students. \r\n          <br/><br/>\r\n          </Text>\r\n          <Tools>Leadership</Tools>\r\n          <Text>\r\n          Being a leader isn't an easy task. While we didn't take an official vote, my starting skill set and attitude towards \r\n            the project made me the best fit for the role, and I was happy to take it knowing it doesn't mean I can just give other \r\n            people my work. \r\n          </Text>\r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            <ImgLong src={capstone}/>\r\n            <Header>\r\n              Blog\r\n            </Header>\r\n            <Tools>\"Plans are useless but planning is indispensable\" - Dwight D.

I'm working with two other students to get this done \r\n              and we also have help from a TA to make sure we're making progress. I opted to take a leadership \r\n              role for my team because not only was I experienced with how React worked, but I also wanted to \r\n              make this app look and perform like it was made by professionals and felt the most confident to get this done. \r\n              <br/><br/>I designed the app, you can interact with it above, and I created a timeline \r\n              for our team to finish a working prototype by the end of March. I assigned my team members with \r\n              creating the front-end, since they felt the most comfortable with it, and I got to work on the back-end.\r\n              <br/><br/>\r\n              I immedietly researched different tools that we would need to learn to accomplish our task. \r\n          I decided to use React Native for the front end since it allowed us to develop for both IOS, \r\n          Android, and web which was ideal since we weren't experienced with app development.\r\n          I then worked closely with the professor to create a <Link href='https://xd.adobe.com/view/8076e940-3750-4138-a939-32692b7e0e67-d525/?fullscreen'>design prototype </Link>\r\n          that would help us plan out the features we would have, the user interface and experience, and helped us \r\n          all be on the page when we would start to develop. <br/><br/>\r\n          To begin development I created a <Link href='https://www.heroku.com/home'>Heroku </Link> server to host an express server.\r\n          Next I started our React Native app and set it up to be able to make API calls. This was mainly to help the group see \r\n          what React frameworks look like. I also set a timeline of the entire app development for us to follow. \r\n              <br/><br/>\r\n            </Text>\r\n            <Tools>Winter Term - The Exicution</Tools>\r\n            <Text>\r\n              The biggest challenge hasn't been the technical side of the project but the team side. The term started off seeming \r\n              fine. Every member agreed with my timeline and said they started work. In week 3 (of 10) I requested for everyone to \r\n              merge their work to Github so we could see all of the progress we've made since we were to present it to other teams soon. I noticed one member did no work beyond what \r\n              they did last term (which was impressive amount) and the other team member ignored all styling and did pretty much \r\n              the minimum. I did expect this, I know people can get busy and have to prioritize their time. Something like this Capstone \r\n              doesn't have any grades and there's no risk of being fired, so of course it can difficult to respect deadlines.\r\n              <br/><br/>\r\n              We gave a presentation in which we focused more on how I set-up our backend and our goals for the term. Afterwards I got my team together \r\n              and let them know I would have liked to see more effort put in. I listened to what my teamates had to say. They understood my disappointment, \r\n              agreed they could have done more, and said they'd catch up and stick to the timeline. Since I was the only one who organized \r\n              our project I asked them if they wanted to make any changes, because I expected I may have given too little time for hard features and \r\n              too much time for easy features. They both said it was still good and so we left the meeting with the plan unchanged.\r\n              <br/><br/> \r\n              At the end of week 7 our project partner asked about when a demo would become available. This caused me to request we all merged our project, \r\n              and gave a realistic evaluation of where we're at. Both members completed what was required ealier, but still didn't match the \r\n              styling with what we had designed. So now was time to pivot. I narrowed down what was core to our application and asked my team \r\n              if we could get there. After finding an agreement, I created a new, short-term timeline to plan what each of us was to do to get a demo \r\n              working by week 10. \r\n            </Text>\r\n            \r\n          </Body>\r\n        </Core>\r\n      </React.Fragment>\r\n    );\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Capstone;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
