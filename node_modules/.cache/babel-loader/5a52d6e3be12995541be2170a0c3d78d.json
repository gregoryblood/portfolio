From this decision, the game came together for me. I made pieces that move like a knight, bishop and rook. (Queen movement was overpowered) Each piece had abilities that gave them purpose. By having more pieces the player has more options to attack without moving, but they have to balance what pieces they want to move out of the way of damage.

I could have made it scale from turns but figured I want to \r\n            pressure the player into making more mistakes. \r\n            <br/><br/>\r\n            Now that the game was sort of fun, I needed to work on the theme. I decided on adding allies the player could control. This \r\n            added more choice for the player and therefore required more thought. Perfect! While I was brainstorming ways this ally can \r\n            move I thought to the game my board looked an awful like with a piece my main character was already. Chess! From this decision, \r\n            the game came together for me. I made pieces that move like a knight, bishop and rook. (Queen movement was overpowered) Each piece \r\n            had abilities that gave them purpose. By having more pieces the player has more options to attack without moving, but they have to \r\n            balance what pieces they want to move out of the way of damage. Some pieces felt better than others and the game as a whole could use \r\n            more testing and difficulty adjusting but by then I was out of time and needed to submit.  \r\n            </Text>\r\n            \r\n          </Body>\r\n        </Core>\r\n      </React.Fragment>\r\n    );\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default KingsGambit;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
